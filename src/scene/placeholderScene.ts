Having completed the tutorial, you're now ready to play the full game!

From the title screen you can continue the single-player adventure mode, slowly accumulating cards and learning about the 6 unique characters as they traverse the city.

Alternatively, in Free Play you can choose from any premade deck to play against the AI or a human opponent, or make your own deck from any of the cards in the game.

Press ESC or click the gear icon in the upper-right to open the options menu, which includes a link to the Discord to stay connected.

Thanks so much for playing! We hope you enjoy and stick around as the game develops.
