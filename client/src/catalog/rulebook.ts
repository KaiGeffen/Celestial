[size=30][b]Overview[/b][/size]

Celestial is a hidden-information game of strategy and psychology. The game centers around the "Story", a row of cards in a particular order on the table. Your opponent's cards in the Story are face down, so you must guess what they're doing and plan around it.

Once neither player wants to add a card to the Story, the cards in the Story are revealed and points are tallied. The player with more points wins that round, and then a new round begins. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game.

Cards have a variety of effects, such affecting what an opponent's card later in the story is going to do, drawing new cards, making the opponent's cards visible to you, or even creating new cards altogether. Predict what the other player is planning and use these abilities to your advantage to outmaneuver your opponent and win the game.

Celestial can be learned in under 10 minutes, while also having a high skill ceiling and replayability. The large card pool empowers many different deck strategies, and the psychological aspect of having to predict what cards the opponent has played and figure out how to counteract the most likely options rewards deep strategic thinking.

[size=30][b]Starting the game[/b][/size]

To begin the game, each player draws 3 cards, then may take a single mulligan. To mulligan, select any number of cards in your hand that you don't want to keep. You'lll draw new cards to replace them, then shuffle the old cards away.

The story is cleared between rounds, but cards in hand and other effects remain. At the beginning of each round, you draw 2 new cards, increase your max breath by 1 (up to a limit of 10), and reset your current breath amount. Then the player who most recently played a card in a previous round takes the first turn.

[size=30][b]Action phase[/b][/size]

During the action phase, a player can either play a card or pass the turn without playing anything. To play a card, you must pay its breath cost, which is the topmost number in the top left corner. When played, a card is face down and not visible to the opponent.

Once both players pass the turn in succession, play ends and the round moves to the ending phase.

Cards are resolved left to right. To resolve a card, you add its points to your point score, then carry out any abilities it may have in its text, then move it to your discard pile.

After all cards have been resolved, the player with the most points wins the round. Once a player has won 5 rounds, that player wins the game.

[size=30][b]FAQ[/b][/size]

[b]Who takes the first turn of the game?[/b]
It's random.

[b]What happens if my deck is empty and I need to draw a card?[/b]
You'll first reshuffle your discard pile back into your deck.

[b]Is my deck in the order that I see when hovering over it?[/b]
No, the true order of the deck is hidden from you. The order you see is sorted by cost.

[b]What does it mean for a card to alter its cost?[/b]
Only the cost you pay is changed; anything else that cares about the card's cost sees the base value. If there are multiple modifications, they're applied in whatever order makes it cheapest.

[b]When exactly does morning occur?[/b]
Morning abilities happen before you draw new cards for the round. If both players have morning abilities, they happen in turn order.

[b]Can I see status effects I currently have?[/b]
Yes, they appear next to your avatar in the bottom left.

[b]What does it mean for a card to be nourished?[/b]
A card counts as being "nourished" if it has any nourish effect applied to its points, even a negative one.

[b]Why don't I get to choose what card to discard?[/b]
Players can't make any choices while the story is resolving, so discard always takes the card on the left of your hand.`
