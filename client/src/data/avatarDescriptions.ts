  `Jules is a restless, fiercely independent soul whose life has been defined by reinvention. From an early age, they carried an imagination too wide for the narrow roles their family and community tried to impose. Creative at heart, Jules found outlets in dance, theater, and art, but grew to see these not as performances for others, but as personal expressions of freedom. Their identity as Jules emerged through resistance—shedding masks, breaking away from expectations, and learning to embrace the fluid, self-defined person within.

As an adult, Jules embodies both resilience and wanderlust. They’ve lived lightly, valuing experience and connection over possessions, and channeling their sharp emotions into art that blends discipline with improvisation. Jules thrives on change: traveling from place to place, forging bonds with strangers, and leaving traces of their creativity in each chapter of life. At their core, they are someone who transforms adversity into momentum—an artist, a wanderer, and a survivor who lives with unshakable devotion to authenticity.`,
