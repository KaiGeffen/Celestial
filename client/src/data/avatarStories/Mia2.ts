export default `    My third therapist, Stacy, seems alright so far. If I had a complaint it would be about her waiting room. It’s awkwardly shaped and cramped, I’m practically bumping knees with other patients while pretending to be invisible. The beige walls, popcorn ceiling, and fluorescent overhead light doesn’t help. I put up with it because at least her office is pleasant and her white sound machine actually works. Plus she doesn’t doubt me the way the last two therapists did. Sometimes her responses feel a little shallow, but I prefer that to being told to look inwards
    Today I have a lot to unload: everything about Simon. Not just our last fight, but also all the conflicts and compromises over the years we’ve been together. For so long, I’ve tried to trust him, like he knew better since he was more “stable”: a people person, a man with a secure job, someone who has their shit together. He made me doubt myself, my own judgements and worth. I set aside my preferences and accepted when things didn’t go my way, again and again. All I needed was for him to at least be on my side and have my best interests at heart.
    “And does he?” Stacy asks.
    “No. For a while I told myself he does, but I think I was just trying to believe in him. I put him on a pedestal.”
    “Because he’s all the things that you’re not.”
    “Yes.”
    “Just as you find complementary strengths in Simon, you need to discover where your gifts lie. What do you have that he doesn’t?”
    The question repeats in my head on the way home. Usually, I’m not keen on that kind of self-evaluation, but today I’m ready to try it. What do I have that Simon doesn’t? Bravery, for one. Spontaneity, a willingness to take risks. Resilience. I’ve been through so much, survived so much. And what about him? I thought he was what I should want to be. But really, he’s just ordinary. And maybe I can’t become that, I’m far beyond that point. What is so admirable about ordinariness, anyway?

    When I step through our front door, the sight of Simon with a subdued hopeful glint in his eyes, makes me hesitate for a moment.
    Still, I manage to get the words out: “Let’s end this.”`
