export default `    Working as a receptionist at a hotel with Sam was one of the easier jobs I had. Though we didn’t live together anymore, Sam pulled some strings to get me even working the same shift as him. We must have made quite the sight: sitting side by side with our bound chests, short hair, and ambiguous hormone-altered voices asking “How can I help you today?” 
    Sam knew how to take full advantage of the position. He would bring in his drawing tablet and connect it to the desktop, flipping from his illustration to the guest registration window whenever a customer or higher up walked by. He always offered me a chance to try it out, and one day I gave in.
    It was a slow weekday, I’d barely seen anyone even pass by on the street for the first two hours of our late night shift. I picked up the pen and made a few strokes on the tablet, watching how they dashed across the desktop screen. One button could completely undo a drawn line, as if it was never there to begin with. It was completely different from the feel of a #2 pencil on composition notebook paper, and the pink eraser that could never fully scrub away a smudge of graphite. I slipped an earbud into one ear and let random songs from my favorites list play while I made all sorts of shapes, colors, and textures flash onto and off of the screen. 
    “You know you can save your work and just open a new canvas for a blank page.” Sam sighed. “At this point you’re not drawing, you’re dancing.”
    I smiled and shrugged, then froze as I saw his expression crumble into dread. I clumsily switched to a new window, but it was too late. When I turned around, our manager asked to speak to us both, individually. 
    I kept my mouth shut and a week later I was fired. A few days afterwards, I received a gift in the mail from Sam: a new drawing tablet, just for me. It came with a note in which he admitted that he threw me under the bus, falsely assuming that I would do the same.`
