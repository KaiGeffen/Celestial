export default `    She was a small, scrappy thing, living in the hollow of the tree stump behind my grandparent’s place. 
    That summer, it was hotter inside than out, so I spent plenty of time poking around in the backyard. When I first heard her meow, I brazenly stuck my hand straight into that dark hole, which earned me an immediate scratch. 
    I learned my lesson and left offerings by the roots instead: tins of salty kippers, shallow bowls of water, things any cat would enjoy. Discovering the empty containers the following day filled me with exhilaration, the same kind I felt finding an empty glass and cookie crumbs on Christmas mornings.
    The trail of three thin red lines that traveled across the back of my hand faded within days, but then a cluster of pink lumps rose in its place. Soon, I was laid up in bed with pulsing aches in every corner of my body. I didn’t whisper a word to my grandparents about the scratch, and I hid the back of my hand from them as best I could. It was my secret summer venture, something adults wouldn’t understand. 
    Between the long naps that left me in pools of sweat, I gazed at the yard through the bedroom window. My hazy mind stumbled through thoughts about the stray, and nothing else. How long had it been since I left her a gift? Was she wondering where I went? Did she know it was because of her scratch? Was she feeling at least a little guilty?
    Once I was well enough to stay awake, I returned to the stump with a fresh tin of sardines. This time, she poked her head out of the hollow when she heard my approach. She must have recognized me, or the smell of fish, because she cautiously emerged. That was my first time laying eyes on her. The indignation over my illness washed away, replaced by the thrill of progress.
    It took another week for her to sniff my fingertips, and then a few days after that she let me stroke her patchy fur. By the end of the summer she would come running at the sound of the screen door swinging open, and weave between my legs in figure-eights. 
    “You’re coming home with me,” I often told her.`
