export default `    When my parents picked me up, my rash had just faded. I made a small plea to bring the stray home with us, which was turned down instantly. 
    “Who will watch her while you’re at school?” Mom asked.
    “Cats are independent, she can be alone for a bit during the day.”
    “Even so, we need you downstairs in the diner after school. Who will watch her then?”
    “Why do I need to stay downstairs? I don’t even do anything to help. Once I finish my homework I just sit around while you and Dad are all busy… it’s so boring. If I had her with me—”
    Mom quickly shut me down, “It’s a sanitation hazard. We can’t have a pet, let alone a stray with who-knows-what kinds of diseases and infestations, wandering around.” As the one managing the front of the house, she was always nagging about those things. She treated the diner like an unvaccinated newborn, even though it’d already been a year since the grand opening.
    “I’ll stay upstairs with her! Please! I don’t like staying in the diner anyway,” I said, mumbling the last part. Dad heard it anyway.
    “Tell me, what’s the big sign at our place say, the one you picked out the colors and font for?” Dad asked, it was something he liked to ask me whenever I expressed any discontent. “What’s it say?” he repeated. 
    “Kitz’s Diner.” 
    “That’s right.”
    Those two words were the seal to any conversation. 
    I turned my head and looked out the window. Still, the image of the sign with its red, cursive letters spelling out my name stuck to the front of my mind, transposing itself onto the scenery that blurred by. I couldn’t remember whose idea it was to name the diner after me, but it wasn’t something I asked for. Owning a restaurant was always my mom’s dream, and my dad took pride in running the kitchen. I wasn’t sure where I fit in the picture. Maybe that was why they chose to put my name on the sign: to wedge me into their vision.`
