export default `     A few years into retirement I suddenly awoke with a hollowing loneliness. I got to work making phone calls and sending out letters, emails, and texts. The time had finally come for me to hit the road again. It was my most extensively planned trip across the country, designed for the purpose of visiting anyone and everyone I knew. There were plenty of people I'd met on the road in my nomadic phases, and others I befriended in the various places I tried to settle down in. My last stop was with Tina and Mark, a couple I had met rather early on in my journey. I was worried it had been too long to reunite comfortably, but despite changing over the years, we got on like old friends. We met on the beach as the sun set. I folded out the tarp extension from the side of my van and they brought foldable chairs to prop up in the sand underneath. We reclined with a sigh and got to talking, passing around Pinot and dried dates. At some point Tina clapped her hands and pointed at my van. "Oh! We need to show you! After we first met you, Mark and I loved that design so much that we just had to ink it." I'd long since upgraded from Skylark, but I kept the emblem on every vehicle I owned. The heavily tattooed couple each held out an arm, and sure enough, that swooping bird sat just below their wrists. Any lingering regret over never putting down roots was carried away by my delighted laughter. The two got up and swayed in each other's arms to the rhythm of the lapping waves and crackling bonfire. I retrieved a pen and took out my travel sketchbook, opening to one of the last remaining blank pages.
