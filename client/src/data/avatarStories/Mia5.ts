export default `    If there was one thing Mr.Hughes wanted more than the undying love of his students, it was tenure. And so, it became my personal mission to make sure he would never get it. I knew that I would never be able to prove what he tried to do to me, so instead I focused on what I could easily expose: the dinners, along with all the pot and liquor he provided his 19 year old students. Our class group chat had enough photos and videos from Mr.Hughes’ place to convince the board. 
    I was supposed to be anonymous, but it was obvious to the others. I was the only one who had stopped calling him by his name and attending his dinners. Eventually Zoe asked me directly, and I told her everything. I always did. She was my roommate, my closest friend. But as I explained everything to her, I saw expressions I didn’t recognize flash across her face. 
    “Scott invited you, and only you?” she asked.
    “Yeah, I didn’t know until I got there.”
    “How do you know he didn’t, though? Maybe the others he invited just couldn’t make it that evening.” 
    “Well, I straight up asked him and he told me it was only me that night,” I explained, confused why it even mattered to her. 
    “But you’re both adults, and nothing even happened. Why do you need to get him fired?”
    “Zoe, he grabbed me! I ran and didn’t look back!” I cried out. It sounded like pleading.
    She let a sigh escape, “Hey, I’m sorry you went through something that felt… triggering, in that way. You’re a hurt person.”

    The group chat was dead for the rest of the semester. My former friends gave me dirty looks whenever the new substitute professor stumbled over words or assigned tedious work. 
    Sometimes they would brush past me in the hall and whisper in an exasperated, mocking tone: “Hurt people, hurt people.” 
    The worst part was not knowing what exactly Zoe had told them. She practically knew my whole life, I poured my heart out to her, and now she wasn’t on my side.`
