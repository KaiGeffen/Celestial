export default `     Jas stands at the podium alone, gripping a folder of papers. Myself and the council sit facing her from elevated tables arranged in an arc, as if we plan to encircle her, trapping her in the center. Her eyes don't waver or pause when she sees me, she probably already knew I'd be here. "I am Jasmine Waters, and I own and run the daycare located on Beacon street. I'm here to inform you, the council, that you are making a terrible mistake. This plant will pollute the air where young children play, sleep, eat, and live. Your grand plans are not worth the cost of the long-term health of our future generations. These developing children deserve to breathe clean air, their hardworking parents deserve peace of mind."

     A brief back and forth takes place, but I don't say a word. Neither does Noah. The next concerned member of the public is called to the stand. I watch Jas exit the room and quickly excuse myself to follow her. "Jas, wait." I call to her in the hallway. She stops, but doesn't say anything. I continue in an unsteady fervor, "This project, it's not meant to be like this- I mean, it's really an opportunity to bring so much to the community. The location… It can't be changed now, it's too ideal. It's not near any schools or hospitals, and it's close to port and highway access." Jas looks ready to turn around, so I blabber on. "The daycare, I'll relocate it. Just wait, once the plant is in operation for a bit and I've earned from my investment, I can completely cover moving your daycare anywhere in the city- even downtown-" "Don't even think of touching what I own." Jas cuts me off with a certain sharpness in her even toned voice. "Do you even know just how hard we all fought while you were off bloodying your hand? We had to pull out all the stops to prevent MetroLine from taking away one of our only local public schools. Now you're inviting them back with open arms and that dirty money. You've really made such great opportunities, just for you and a select few people. Not for all of us. Don't delude yourself." She walks off before I can respond, but I'm left without words anyway. No defense makes it way to my mind, let alone my lips.
