export default `    I entered college as a --- major, which had a particularly small number of students that year. The group of only twelve quickly became a close circle, but no one was as tight as Zoe and I.
    Zoe also happened to be my roommate, and she reminded me a lot of Mae. She only needed one alarm to get up in the morning and by the time I dragged myself out of bed, she would already have her hair and makeup done; natural and effortless, as if she woke up with the perfect fringe and rosy cheeks. When she spoke to you, she had this way of making you feel like the most important person on earth. Zoe’s big blue eyes would scan my face while I told some anecdote about a class or an ex, widening or narrowing at all the right moments.
    Zoe never complained about my messy side of the room or my noisy sleep habits. If my screaming woke her up, she’d gently wake me and hold my hand over the small gap between our beds. I was both shocked and thrilled when she said she wanted to be my roommate again.
    Sophomore year was going well; my classes were with my friend group and my best friend was my roommate. Then our seminar professor retired over winter break and a new guy, Mr.Hughes, took over for that second semester. He was young, funny, and clever. He told us to call him Mr.H, or by his first name, Scott. Everyone loved him. I thought he was just ok. Then he started hosting dinners. At first it was always all twelve of us attending, then the invitations became more selective, but never failed to include me and Zoe. She was always so excited, how could I say no? But that one evening she wasn’t there. She wasn’t even invited. It was only me.  `
