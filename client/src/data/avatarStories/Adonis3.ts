export default `    I’m probably going to be fired for randomly dipping mid-shift, but for now I don’t care. The only thing on my mind is that phone call from Gavin- his trembling voice begging for help. He follows close as I pick up Kierra’s limp body and stow her in the cab. I can hear her wheezing and Gavin’s faint sniffles as we speed to the ER.
    “What do you mean wait? She can’t breathe, look at her!” I shout at reception.
    “Everyone is here for an emergency and tonight, like most nights, we’re backed up, there’s nothing we can do.”
    I curse under my breath. “How far is the next closest ER?”
    “At least a half an hour, and they’re also always busy. You’re better off waiting here.”
    We sit in that crowded waiting room, surrounded by coughing and groaning and the stench of blood. Keirra leans on my shoulder, wheezing heavier than before.
    “What happened to Kierra?” I ask Gavin, who sits on the other side of her. 
    “She has hay fever, it started yesterday. Mom and Dad both work tonight so I was looking after her. She was just sleeping when she suddenly had a coughing fit, and after that she’s been struggling to breathe.”
    “Did you give her the inhaler?”
    “The one we had expired, Mom and Dad were trying to get a new one but there were some issues with insurance or something, I don’t know, it was taking a while to get.”
    I feel frustration heat up my skin, but all I can do is close my eyes. 
    “Sorry for making you leave work. You’re the only one who could make it in time.”
    I reach over Kierra to place a hand on Gavin’s shoulder. “You did the right thing, and that’s not what I’m pissed about.”
    My anger was for my namesake, a man who didn’t know how to hustle. Mom, who doesn’t even have a work Visa, has a better work ethic than him and is always finding better paying families to work for. Dad, a citizen, has just maintained his mid-level position at a factory with a 2 hour commute for the past decade. Whenever he’s around he smiles like we’re rich and acts like a caring father, but he can’t even get the twins their life-saving medicine. 
    “Andy? Andy that kinda… hurts.” Gavin’s voice pulls me back and I release the grip I unconsciously tightened.
    “Sorry Gav, I got distracted.”

    When they finally took Kierra in after two hours of waiting, a nurse emerged just fifteen minutes later to tell us our sister was dead.`
