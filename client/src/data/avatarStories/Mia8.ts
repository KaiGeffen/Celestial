export default `    Dad’s new girl, Charlene, moved in only a month after Mom passed. 
    She liked to wear gaudy bright lipstick and smiled wide while she paraded us around in public as a happy little family. When I wore my face wrong she’d pinch my cheek with her manicured talons. I never understood why that was considered an affectionate gesture. She’d pinch me in other places too, but discreetly. If I said something she didn’t like while we talked with my classmates and their parents一 like correcting them when they called her my mom一 she’d stroke my head and then sneakily pinch the back of my neck, hard. 
    When Dad was at work it was just me and her in that cramped home. A living room, kitchen, two bedrooms, one bathroom一 all on one floor. Charlene was like a grizzly during breeding season: territorial and mean. I had no lock on my door and no extra rooms to hide in. There was no escaping her. Charlene made all sorts of arbitrary rules that came and went like the wind: no closing doors, no leaving them open, shoes on indoors, no shoes on indoors, things of that nature that were sure to trip me up. What really mattered to her was getting to punish me in equally strange ways: not making any noise in front of her for the whole week, cleaning the bathroom everyday for her, standing facing the corner in the living room until Dad came home, throwing out all my homework, listing ten things I hate about myself, etc. 
    Dad and I didn’t have many moments for just the two of us, so it took me a while to say anything. When I did, all I could manage was, “I don’t like Charlene, she’s real mean to me.” He gave me a confused stare, like it didn’t compute. That was it. I don’t know what prompted him to dump her, but it certainly wasn’t my accusations towards her. Maybe her clinginess and constant nagging finally wore him down. 
    Then he hired a babysitter named Mae. I warmed up to her quickly, and to my horror, so did Dad. They started dating and I braced myself for her to switch up on me, but she didn’t. If anything, it was an upgrade nudging her closer to something of a mother to me. I still wish that lasted.`
