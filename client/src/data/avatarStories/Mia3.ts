    “Are you joking?” I ask, incredulous. 
    “I think it’d be a good idea to cool off over the weekend and see how things at work feel next week.”
    “Did you even hear everything I told you about that place? I’ve got a target on my back and it’s suffocating.”
    “I know, but sometimes that’s the norm for a new hire. Think of it as initiation. More importantly, the opportunity for a spot at [company name] isn’t something you come across everyday, and you worked so hard—”
    Before he can ramble on I put my foot down, “Opportunity? So that’s what this is about? You want me to grit my teeth and take whatever’s thrown at me for a salary?”
    Simon sighs, “No, Mia. Now you’re just exaggerating.” His voice remains mild, but I can hear the traces of frustration wrapped up in it.
    “It’s not even my kind of job; everything there is slow, inefficient grunt work. I’d get so much done if they let me work independently,” I try to explain. Simon’s calm, unconvinced expression irks me, and I blurt out: “So, sorry if I’m not jumping for joy to become a wage slave like you.”
    “Maybe I’m just a wage slave. And maybe you’re not a victim,” he snaps.
    “What? Wait, what do you mean—”
    He cuts me off, “Maybe you’re just avoidant and looking for an excuse to get out of anything that doesn’t perfectly meet your standards.” 
    I don’t think Simon has ever cut me off before, not like this, not intentionally. His words crowd my mind and my eyes grow hot with tears. Why do I always end up crying in front of him? 
    Simon wraps his arms around me and rests his chin on my head while I sob into his chest. For a moment it’s comforting, but it quickly turns stifling. 
    “I’m sorry Mia, I went too far.”
    I shove him away. I hear his teeth gnash together after I roughly jerk my head up, hitting his jaw. If it hurts, he doesn’t let it show. I start crying even harder, incapable of getting words out. Simon just walks away— slow and silent. When he reaches the doorway he looks back, maybe hoping I’d say something, anything, tell him not to leave. But I can’t. He closes the door, leaving me alone in the darkness. `
