export default `     The day after that terrible Easter, I had geometry class first period. I laid my head down on my desk, It wasn't as if I'd be participating anyway. Besides, I actually performed well in that course when it came to assignments and exams, so one period of slacking should've been excusable. As soon as my cheek touched the cool surface of my desk, I heard the stern stride of Mr.Acker approach. He began to yammer in my ear with more passion than he ever spared any of his lessons. Even when I promised to still pay attention, or that it would be just for today- just one period of ease, he doubled down, taking further offence at my attempt to negotiate. It hit me then: he had been waiting for this moment. I recalled how I was always cold called more than the other quiet students, and how Mr.Acker spent the majority of test periods hovering around my desk. Now that I'd finally given him something to call "misbehavior", he wouldn't let it go. I shot up from my seat, and faced him eye to eye before pushing past him, intending to leave the room. Something suddenly jerked me back, and I spun around to find the hood of my sweatshirt clenched tight in his knobby knuckles. Before I could form a full thought, my own clenched fist went hurtling towards the sickening smirk on his face. Following that incident, my life at high school became just as suffocating as my life at home. Suddenly everyone had a reason to feel justified in making me a target. Perhaps due to my immaturity, I figured I might as well do at school what I couldn't do at home: act out. Every time I responded to a teacher's provocation by yelling, shutting down, or storming out, I was foolishly pouring myself into the mold they had created.
