export default `    Home was depressing, especially at night.
    In the evenings Dad would return from working in a hot, busy kitchen and sit zombified in front of the T.V., sinking into the couch like a dead weight. It was suffocating. Even if I retreated to my room, I could hear the mindless chatter of infomercials or the noisy sound effects of cheesy action movies. 
    The dark night welcomed me as it would any other rebellious teen. Kevin had his own car. A shitty car, but that didn’t matter. Every weekend it reliably got us from one shady corner of town to another. When I stepped outside, the air on my skin felt like a kiss. It took me in, cloaking me from head to toe. Unlike the unforgiving daylight that always bore into me, leaving me exposed. The night was dangerous its own way, a way that felt more thrilling than uncomfortable.
    I got bolder: I started leaving on weeknights as well, and returning at later and later hours. In one instance, Dad finally stopped me as I strode shamelessly past him to leave. He scolded me and even tried to ground me, as if we were an ordinary parent-child pair. It was strange. I humored him that night, but continued to sneak out afterwards. 
    Turns out Dad had a hidden talent for tracking. Somehow he’d show up at whatever parking lot, dive bar, gas station, or house I happened to be in. At times it took him a while, other times he’d intercept me before the night even really began. On the silent ride home, I often wondered why he became a chef when he had the makings of a detective. 
    But that night I guess he was on the later side. Maybe he was rusty, I hadn’t snuck out for a while leading up to that night. I don’t know if it was him who found me一 he never said and I never asked一 but when I woke up in a hospital bed he was there, sitting with his head in his hands.`
