export default `     I check the sticky note to make sure we're at the right house: 153 Oak street. I look back at the brownstone, the bronze plaque reads "153". The door swings open only a split second after I ring the doorbell. "Andy!" Mom must be really surprised, she always calls me Junior, never Andy, since that's also my dad's name. "Are you okay? You even brought the twins!" She gasps, noticing Gavin and Kierra at my side. "Yea, we're fine. We just wanted to surprise you at work" I explain. She puts her fingers to her brow- not a good sign. "Junior, are you crazy? I gave you the address for emergencies. And you even dragged the twins all the way here on foot. They can't be outside like this during allergy season, you know that." "But we wanted to see you too!" Gavin pipes up. "I know, baby. This is on your big brother." Mom sighs. On me? I feel my stomach drop. "I'm sorry Mom, I thought it'd be fun, the twins were all upset and crying and-" "You meant no harm, I get it. Relax." She shakes her head. Children's laughter rings out from further inside the house. "I've got to go now, these kids are young I can't keep my eyes off them for long. But here, take this and get a cab home." She takes some folded up cash from her back pocket and hands it to me. She starts to shut the door, but steps back onto the stoops and plants a kiss on my forehead. I make a face, I'm 13- too old for that mushy stuff, but it does make me feel lighter inside. In the cab home the twins sit on either side of me, both seem on the verge of falling asleep. I didn't realize how quickly young kids wear out. Kierra is the first to doze off, laying her head in my lap. I keep my eyes locked on the window, unable to look away from this unfamiliar side of the city: street planter boxes with color flower arrangements, curly fur dogs groomed like hedges, and an unbelievable amount of cafes and restaurants.
