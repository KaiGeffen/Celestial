export default `    The young lawyer seated across from me recounted her road to success and next ambitions with a little too much enthusiasm. As I took my final sip of coffee, her neglected cup was still nearly full. I leaned back and let my gaze wander over her shoulder, to the window behind her. It had an especially beautiful copper frame that transformed the rainy street into a live painting. 
    That was when I first laid eyes on her. She walked into the framed view slowly, as if she wasn’t soaked to the bone. The rain made her dark hair even darker, which in turn made the pale skin it clung to even paler. The yellow dress that hung awkwardly on her thin frame made her complexion appear sickly, like a risen corpse. 
    “Excuse me for a moment,” I said, finally interrupting my date’s monologue. I grabbed the umbrella and jacket from the back of my chair and raced outside. She had only just made it past the next storefront, and I quickly caught up with her. 
    “Uh, hello,” I called out. She turned around, her unfocused eyes suddenly sharpening with caution. 
    “What do you want?” She asked, taking a step back. There was an unexpected steadiness to her hostile voice that left me flustered.
    “Nothing! I mean, I don’t want anything… from you, I just—well I guess I wanted—to offer you an umbrella,” I stammered like a fool. “You looked like you could use one.”
    As I watched the realization flicker across her stiff face, I thought I shouldn’t have said the last part aloud. She quickly crossed her arms over her chest and turned away, glancing around at other pedestrians nervously. I pulled off my jacket and draped it onto her. Her shoulders jumped, and she looked back at me, still wary.
    “It’s long. You can keep it, or throw it away once you get inside, up to you,” I said. She didn’t respond, but she slipped her arms into the sleeves and zipped up the front. I held out the open umbrella, letting the rain hit me. “You don’t need to return this, either. So just take it.”

    When I returned to the cafe a bit wet, my date smiled.
    “That was kind of you, running out there to give someone an umbrella,” she said, “I think I’d like to see you again sometime.”
    “I’m sorry, I don’t think we’re a good fit.”
    “Really? I like you, though. You don’t… you don’t feel the same?” she muttered, sounding genuinely hurt. My heart twinged.
    “Hey, it’s not that you’re unlikable, you’re just too good for me.”
    “That’s the least believable excuse a man can give,” she sighed.
    “I know it’s tossed around a lot, but I really mean it. You’re too… put-together, capable, confident. You don’t need me.”

    And I really did mean it.
