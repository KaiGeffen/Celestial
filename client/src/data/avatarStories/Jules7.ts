export default `    With nothing left to stay for, I took myself, my savings, one suitcase of belongings, and a backpack on a one-way flight to California. My first stop was an RV dealership, where an overzealous salesman led me around the baking hot lot. He proudly presented the latest top models of Class A and C motorhomes. I was impressed by the sleek storage, private bedrooms, high-tech kitchenettes, rain showers, and skylights, until they were followed up by a fair but enormous price.
    The next price bracket took me to the older models of towable trailers with classic furnishings and warm beige color pallets. Unfortunately, the cost was still a bit startling. My salesman grew reluctant, but I insisted on seeing the true deals. In a shady corner towards the back of the lot there were a few options well within my budget: used campervans. Some looked like they came straight from a demolition derby, and none of them were particularly roomy. But like fate, a humble baby blue beauty sporting only a few scratches caught my eye. She was compact- a skinny bed took up most of the space between the kitchenette and bathroom, which did not include a shower. A single fish-patterned curtain in front of the toilet was the most privacy the vehicle offered. 
    I named her Skylark, Sky for short. The tablet I refused to touch out of bitterness, but brought along anyway, finally became of use. With it, I designed an emblem of a bird swooping around the sun, and had it painted over the most noticeable scratch. 
    With that, my grudge was dissolved and something within me was opened up. I began to draw everyday, even posting some of my pieces: fanart from the latest popular franchise, comic strips about whatever odd job I worked, and portraits of the people I met. Through different commissions and side projects I earned some bonus income for myself. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to supplement my travel funds as needed. `
