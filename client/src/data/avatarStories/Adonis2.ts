export default `    “Here, breakfast.” I hand Jas the coffee and chocolate donut I picked up on the way to her house. She lifts off the lid and brings the cup up to her nose. Her eyes close like she’s savoring the smell of premium espresso, not Deli drip coffee. 
    “Thanks babe.” 
    As we start walking to the bus stop I take out a greasy paper bag and tear off a chunk of cruller, popping it into my mouth.
    “So, how come I didn’t see you in Spanish yesterday? Again.” Jas asks.
    I try to prematurely swallow the bite of cruller, which sends me into a coughing fit. Jas laughs and slaps my back a few times, with almost too much force. 
    “It’s the last class of the day so I beat the rush home if I skip. And yesterday I actually really had to, I had an interview downtown.”
    “Downtown? You didn’t tell me about that.” She scrunches her nose in disgust.
    “I know you think it’s all gentrified and shit down there, but if I can get a gentrified paycheck out of it, maybe it’s not too bad.” I joke. “I interviewed to be a doorman at a commercial building. I didn’t tell you since I thought I’d get turned down, but yesterday it went kinda well. I think I have a good chance.”
    “Congrats, I guess. But that was like the fifth time you’ve missed Spanish.”
    “Good thing it’s the least important subject.”
    Jas looks frustrated. “That’s not the point. It’ll still look bad on paper. Real bad for college apps.” 
    “College?” I scoff. Then I remember she’s my girl, my girl with that light in her honey colored eyes. She’s my girl who wants to walk the straight path after losing her big brother, and she wants to take me with her. “I’m still thinking about it.” I add.
    Jas sips her coffee silently for a moment. The ends of her scarf flutter in the crisp morning breeze. “You’ve been plotting with Ty and Noah, still? About turning this place around?”
    The bus screeches to a slow halt in front of us and the door pops open with a mechanical hiss. 
    I’ve known Ty and Noah my whole life, we’re each other’s closest friends. We all have family here, people we can’t bring ourselves to leave behind. Noah is a few years older, he hasn’t gone to college but he’s set on joining the city council. Honestly, it’s possible. He knows everyone, has connections in both the brightest and darkest ends of this community, including the people that Jas can never forgive. 
    As I sit down with her, I answer carefully, “We’ve been talking. It’s just talk, as always.”
    	Jas doesn’t respond. She leans her head against the window and closes her eyes.`
