export default `    The parts of my 5am jog that typically ground me- the steady rhythm of my breath, the familiar storefronts, the soles of my sneakers hitting the pavement- fade into the background as my thoughts take over.
    Gavin turned down my invitation to this jog, as usual, but this time he added that he’d join me this weekend. Why did he give in? He hates early mornings. I know he must’ve sensed my growing restlessness. 
    I pass by yet another abandoned lot. Like all the others it’s got barriers up but no signage or scaffolding, no hint of a future beyond an eyesore that keeps rent down. Then, in the pale darkness of dim streetlights, I glimpse someone in my periphery. It happens some mornings, but today I’m on edge. I turn left at the corner and the figure mirrors me. 
    Was Mom right? Has giving back to my community- what she calls “flaunting wealth”- put a target on my back? When I hear the stranger’s footsteps fall faster, my legs react before I do, attempting to break into a sprint. That old ache shoots through my right leg and my knee nearly buckles. I bite back a groan and duck into the stairway entrance of a home. I keep my back against the wall and wait. Right as my pursuer turns into the entryway, I move to lunge, but first I catch a glimpse of his face and stop.
    “Jesus, Andy!” Noah exclaims. “I just wanted to say hello. Didn’t you hear me calling out to you?”
    “No… sorry, I don’t know what just happened. You okay?” 
    “Yea, I’m good. What about you? How’s it to be home again? I wanted to drop by some time, but I didn’t know if you’d be cool with that since you stopped writing back a while ago.”
    “Oh. That was just, that was on me. It wasn’t personal. But what are you doing out here so early?” I clumsily change the subject, but Noah lets it slide. He picks up the clipboard that he dropped in surprise.
    “Just some city council business. Ty’s company- MetroLine- is interested in making a concrete plant in the area. It would hopefully spark some development, or at least make it easier.” Noah replies.
    In that moment, I feel transported back to our juvenile meetings at Noah’s tiny apartment. The adrenaline lingering inside me with nowhere to go finally dissipates. “Tell me more.”`
