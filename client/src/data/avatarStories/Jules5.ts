export default `    My hand shook as I tried the key, it had been half a year since I dropped out of high school and got kicked out of home. To my relief, the sound of a click confirmed they hadn’t changed the locks. Even though I chose a time both Mom and Dad would be out of the house, a chill of unease seized me as soon as I stepped inside. After couch surfing and living out of my backpack for months, I finally found a stable enough serving job to split rent with a few roommates. As nice as it was to be able to settle in, I had dreaded returning to my parents’ house for my things. 
    My room was just as I had left it- a complete mess. I set the rolling suitcase my roommate Sam lent me on my unmade bed and began to pack. It hadn’t been all that long since the days that I’d come home, lock myself in my room, and amp up my minispeaker to its limit. Yet looking at it now felt strangely distant, as if it had been years since I was that helpless wild teen.
    I was almost shocked by my own collection of excess: half-full journals with more doodles than notes, piles of redundant clothes, peeling band posters, random trinkets I had assigned some sentimental value. Living lightly made me realize how little I really needed. I folded up a few plain, work-appropriate shirts. My favorite graphic tee- featuring a cartoon rave couple ballroom dancing- called to me. I nearly placed it in the suitcase before I came to my senses and tossed it aside. I had no need for that kind of cope anymore.
    I was about to leave the room before I glanced over my shoulder to give it one last look. I didn’t think or hesitate when I let go of the suitcase and rolled up my sleeves. I just started tidying up like it was the natural thing to do. I didn’t listen to any music or set a timer like I usually would while cleaning. I simply worked silently- my hands moving on their own to organize my desk, straighten up posters, and put away clothes. The last thing I did was fluff the pillow on my made up bed. Satisfied, I clicked the light switch off and left without looking back. The suitcase I pulled glided on the hardwood floors with the same pace and rumble as when I entered. But as I dragged it behind me I could feel the subtly increased weight from my belongings.`
