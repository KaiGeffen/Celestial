export default `    As a teen I gradually discarded every personal item that felt like a mask: butterfly wall decals, colorful clothes, my old glitter-covered backpack. It was fine until that Easter Sunday, when Mom realized I had no dress to wear to my grandparents’ place. I think that was when it clicked for her: this wasn’t the typical phase of a teen trying to mature too fast.

    Mom was silent as she drove us to Macy’s. Once inside, I was overwhelmed by frigid AC’d air that stank of floral soap and the vice-like grip Mom held on my wrist while pulling me through the store. There wasn’t a sound between us, only the feel-good pop songs that blared from all directions as Mom led us to the women’s section. She stopped in front of the very first rack and took a random dress, pushing it to my chest with enough force to feel like a punch. I held onto it quickly, as if it were the reins of a spooked horse. But it gave me no power to steer as Mom ushered me into a changing room. Finally having a moment to myself, I looked over the dress and noticed just how awful it really was. I called out to Mom, telling her how the colors didn’t look right for me, and it might be a size too big. “Put it on.” She spat back, sounding closer to the other side of the door than I expected. I tried to open the door to show her, but the handle wouldn’t budge. My stomach lurched and my heart began to hammer in my chest. “I said put it on.” Mom repeated while holding the changing room door shut from outside.

    The family photo taken that day was framed and hung in the entry hallway of the house. In it, I stood off to the side as if trying to avoid the camera, but my awkward distance from the group only brought more attention to the ill-fitting sundress cluttered with garish floral patterns. My short hair failed to hide the sales tag that poked out from my neckline. That became the last printed picture of me displayed at home. `
