export default `    I decide to take the bus to the cemetery. The crowd on board resembles what I can recall from my high school commute, all appearing to be locals. I turn my focus to the window for the rest of the ride. A sudden spring shower starts, dotting my view with rolling droplets. There aren’t any landscaped planter boxes, but the sidewalks look a bit cleaner, brighter somehow. Though, that could just be a projection of what I want to see.
Scaffolding surrounds what used to be an empty lot. There is a sign, it says commercial, but it blurs into the distance before I can catch what business will be moving in.

    When I arrive the drizzle fades and Gavin is already there, without him it probably would’ve taken me a while to find the right plot. The stone has smooth edges, a glossy shine, and defined engravings with “Kierra” in a cursive font. It looks surprisingly new, she must’ve been well cared for by the others all these years. 
    “I’m sorry it took so long for me to visit.” I say aloud, to both of the twins.
    “It’s alright, you were preoccupied for a long time.” Gavin reassures me.
    “Uh-huh, I bet you’re busier now than I ever was, Doctor.”
    Gavin sheepishly rubs the back of his neck, still awkwardly humble about the title he’s earned. 
    “She’d be so proud.” I add. I mean it, but those words sting. Could I say the same about me? The brother that couldn’t even face her resting place for years after the funeral.
    “And it wouldn’t have been possible without you.” Says Gavin. I look away from him. I don’t want to search his face for traces of obligation and hidden resentment. I want to believe him. But facing Kierra leaves me wondering what she’d think of me, of everything I’ve done. 
    “You good?” my brother asks. 
    I nod and take out a crystalline bead with a purple hyacinth blossom inside the center, placing it at the base of the stone.`
