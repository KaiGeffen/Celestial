export default `    That evening I recognized her silhouette in the restaurant parking lot immediately. I tried to get a little closer before calling out to her, but once I was within a yard of her, she spun around with her right hand clenching something in her purse.
    “Woah, just wanted to say hi.”
    “You’re that guy…” she muttered. Her expression showed a hint of relief, before becoming even stonier. “Have you been following me?”
    “What? No, never.”
    She lifted the spray bottle out of her bag.
    “I moved to the area recently. After my mom passed nearby,” I blurted out.
    “Oh, oh I’m so sorry—” she gasped and fumbled with her belongings, trying to shove the pepper spray away. The top clattered onto the pavement. We both reached down to grab it when the spray tube slid out from her purse, hitting the ground right on the nozzle. The hiss of spray releasing sent us both running.

    “Come, just put your eyes under a faucet… that one looks free.”
    “Are you sure? What about you?” I asked, my eyes still squeezed shut as she guided me into the restaurant kitchen.
    “ I’m fine, I’ve got a wet towel for my eyes.”
    After a few seconds under the water I pulled my head back and blinked
    “Am I crazy or is pepper spray pretty mild?” I asked while drying off my face.
    “Well, actually it’s just some cooking oil mixed with water. I don’t trust myself with the real thing,” she admitted. “But, still, I’m really sorry some got on you.”
    “You said you work here?”
    “For the time being…”
    I blinked my eyes open and asked,“Have you tried the bar’s tasting menu?” She shook her head. “Come split it with me. My friends are never game. Always saying they’re ‘too full’ after dinner.”
    “You mean like, the uh, wine and cheese thing? That’s a little…”
    “My treat.” 
    
    She swirled the wine glass and took a deep inhale, just as I taught her.
    “The aroma is… citrus-y?” she looked up at me for approval, her rosy cheek leaned lazily against the glass.
    “Good, what else?”
    She sighed, steadied the glass under her nose and closed her eyes.
    “Something, what did you call it earlier? When there’s greens—Ah! Vegetal, and maybe herbaceous notes?”
    “Look at you! Cheers!” I applauded, and she eagerly took a sip of the wine. Even this far into the tasting menu, I didn’t grow tired of watching her face light up, relax, and contemplate (or even scrunch up in disgust) as she tried each delicacy for the first time. 
    “So, I don’t mean to pry, but as your victim I think I deserve to know: why carry around the fake pepper spray?” I finally asked. I really wanted to ask how she can be so defensive yet vulnerable at once, so stubborn yet incompetent, in a way that made my heart pound in my head. She avoided my gaze and smacked her lips as if still savoring her sip of wine. 
I lowered my voice and looked off wistfully, “We're in a pretty nice area. My mom wouldn’t have settled for anything unsafe,” I added. I could feel her sympathetic eyes land on me.
    “I’ve had some bad experiences in the past. Some impulsive exes and pushy strangers. I’m new here, too. Still getting used to ‘letting my guard down’, I guess,” she explained with an awkward smile. “I think you’ve already helped with that, a bit.”
