export default `     It was a hot day towards the end of fifth grade when I suddenly turned off from my typical route home. My bookbag repeatedly thumped against my back as the bicycle rumbled down the uneven dirt road, approaching the abandoned home I'd heard whispers about in school. After stopping in the lot's front yard I leaned my belongings against the wide trunk of an old oak tree. A simple wood plank swing hung from its sturdiest branch. When I sat on it my toes dangled just above the blades of overgrown grass. I dug around my pockets for my IPod and opened my "Ballroom" playlist. "Sing, Sing, Sing" came on- the song our dance instructor used to teach us the swing. The fitting coincidence brought a brief smile to my face as I pumped my legs to pick up momentum on the actual swing.

     I closed my eyes to imagine practicing my steps. I had it down, every triple step and turn. I pushed my legs out and swung even higher. As my stomach lurched I realized I was imagining the wrong role, the lead. The fuzzy image of my own shorter form entered my mind's eye. I watched myself stumble as the boy pulled me along. My eyes shot open, the view of the blue sky and leafy oak branches chasing away the unpleasant image. I reached higher on each rope and pulled myself up, standing upright on the seat of the swing. With a deep breath I shut my eyes again, hoping to see the dance through to the end. This time I was on the stage with the rest of the grade, and as my partner spun me I saw the magenta skirt Mom bought for the occasion flare out around me. And this time, my eyes were forced open by the sudden feeling of air beneath my feet, which had fully slipped from the plank.
