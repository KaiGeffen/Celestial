export default `    I never called my grandparents on my own, but that year I did. I had to.
    “There is a cat living in your backyard. Could you leave her some food once in a while? Or at least some water?” 
    “Oh, dear…” my grandma gasped. The tone of her voice made my heart drop.
    “What is it?” 
    “A few nights ago there was this terrible yowling. Your grandaddy went out and checked, found the poor thing in a bad way,” she said, “I’m sorry Kitz, we didn’t know you made friends with it…”
    I held my breath, waiting for her to continue.
    Finally, she sighed, “Grandaddy had to put it down.”
    “No… no! Why didn’t you help her?”
    “It was too late, she was injured, bad.”
    “How? Why? You could’ve, could’ve saved her!” I insisted.
    “Listen, the cats up here aren’t like the ones you see in pet stores and homes in the city. This one was a wild animal, it belonged to mother nature and she can be unforgiving.”
    
    From then on I was glad to live in the city, where I believed the merciless chaos of nature had no reach. I was mistaken.
    If my parents fought, they never let me see it. That was an impressive feat, since I was around most of the time. Even if I was allowed to be upstairs alone, I could still hear the clatter of dishes and chatter of voices. The smell of bacon and coffee clung to all three of us- something I initially hated, but after living in that smell for so long my nose became numb to it. Whenever someone else noticed it, I told them “It’s my diner, after all.” 
    That night, Mom and Dad sat across from me in one of our booths and told me the diner had to close and they would be splitting up. Stupefied, all I could ask was why. That impossible question provoked the first ever fight I witnessed. Mom began to explain dwindling earnings and climbing costs. When she mentioned something about the menu not adapting, Dad suddenly jumped in, adding that budgeting wasn’t properly communicated to the kitchen. Then it became a constant back and forth, each pointing the finger at each other for ruining what could’ve been.
