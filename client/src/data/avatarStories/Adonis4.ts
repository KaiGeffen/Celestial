export default `     Mitchel, Duke, and I sit in the back of the Humvee as it rumbles along, stirring up clouds of sand as we travel back to base. It's another uneventful day of re-scouting areas of the empty desert. We rehash old stories of rare enemy encounters, further exaggerating the moments of action with each retelling. Always an even closer encounter, an even cleaner shot, an even more terrified expression on the target's face, etc. I know from Gavin's letters that it's the type of talk that would horrify a college discussion circle and spark a lecture on humanity, violence, and the evils of Western conquest. Sometimes a lingering sentiment in line with that criticism shoots through me, but I ignore it every time. I'm here to provide for myself, for my family, for our future. "And that's when I realize I only have half a mag left…" Duke says, a grin creeping across his sun-burnt face. The Humvee drives over something and I hear, or feel, an almost imperceptible whistle of a 'click'. There's a flash of white light and the next thing my vision captures is a ball of flames. A force hits me like a punch and I'm slammed through the side door I'd been leaning against while an enormous bang registers to my ears. I feel a pop deep in both my ears as a second wave of wind sends me flying away from the vehicle. At first I can't sense any pain in my body, just the ringing in my ears while I try to orient myself in the plume of dust. Then I see the Humvee several yards from me, flipped upside down and engulfed in flames. Suddenly sensation returns to me, searing pain spreads across my skin. I open my mouth to scream, but the pang of stabbing pain from my right thigh rips my voice from me. I look down and see the piece of shrapnel lodged in my leg, and I feel my consciousness flicker. A scorching heat inside of me keeps me awake, the heat of indignation and resentment for everything I haven't yet seen achieved. I roll onto my side, keeping my uninjured leg on the ground as I pull myself forward, crawling, no, dragging myself away from the blazing wreckage.
