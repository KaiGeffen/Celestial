export default `    I left college, but not out of guilt for what I did. I definitely had regrets. I regretted ever opening up to that snake and suppressing my gut instincts about that professor for as long as I did. I didn’t regret getting him dismissed, even if my “friends” would come to hate me for it. 
    I left because ever since then, I could feel their eyes, hear their whispers, and see their little smirks. In that tiny major, I would’ve been stuck in classes with those eleven until graduation. I’d gotten my vengeance, so what about them? Who knows what they would’ve been able to come up with in the two years we had left together? A sudden awareness of my surrounding panopticon dawned on me. I had to escape it. Little did I know, it persisted everywhere.
    I didn’t have the resources for a fresh start; a new major or college. Instead I sunk my teeth into any opportunity that seemed fit. First, a public library, then a grocery store, a zoo, a hookah bar. The pay was never enough, the hours always too long, the coworkers always too loud, and management watching too closely. At each station, the conditions would slowly grate down on me until I snapped. I never left quietly anymore. I left in a storm, making sure there was a mess for them to clean up after. That is what each workplace deserved for attempting to subdue me, hold me captive. 
    I was working at an animal shelter when I met Simon. I saw him around the same time every Monday through the storefront window as he paused to study each adoptable dog on display. For a while he didn’t even notice me noticing him. When, one Monday, he finally looked up and met my eyes, he froze like he was caught puppy-napping. I waved at him, which he seemed to take as a command, and he reluctantly dragged himself inside. 
    “You’re always windowshopping. When are you going to just take the plunge?” I asked as he approached the counter sheepishly.
    “I don’t know… I don’t know if I should. I mean, they might be able to find much better homes. I don't think I’m ready to be that… perfect owner yet.”
    “Pffft, perfect? Even a below average owner would be an upgrade for any of these mutts. They live trapped in a box, surrounded by each other’s unending stink and incessant barking.”
    “Really? They’re kept in those crates all day?”
    I nodded, “Their only break is if prospective buyers- I mean, adopters- want to walk them. Or when I’m on my lunch break.”
    “You have to walk them on your own time? Isn’t it part of your job?”
    “Nope. But cleaning piss and shit from their crates is.”
    He smiled, “That’s kind of you. You don’t even seem that fond of dogs.”
    “I’m really not, but you seem to be. Take one home with you.”
    “You make a solid pitch, but I’ll need some time to think on it.”
    I thought I’d scared him away, but the next Monday he walked right in and asked to walk one of the dogs. That’s how a new routine started, and at some point he lined up the timing with my breaks. We’d walk together, sometimes he’d buy me lunch. 
    He never ended up giving a dog a home, but within the year we were living together.`
