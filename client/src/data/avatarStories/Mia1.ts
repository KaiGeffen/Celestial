export default `    I empty live crickets into Leo’s vivarium. He darts out from under his log and chases his prey energetically. 
    “Isn’t it nice to eat at night, as a proper nocturnal critter should?” I ask him.
    Simon was squeamish at the sight of things like live insects, reptiles too. He could barely tolerate keeping one leopard gecko in our bedroom. What a wimp. I could only feed Leo in the morning after Simon left for work. He was always sluggish during those hours, unable to fully enjoy his meals.
    My phone rings, it’s Chelsea.
    “Hi Chels,” I say. I click the speaker button and plop down on the queen-sized bed, spreading out my limbs to indulge in all the space that now belongs to only me.
    “Mia! How are you? I’ve been trying to reach you all day.”
    “Sorry. I was probably just napping, or busy. I’m doing well, though. Really well.”
    Chelsea’s voice sounds hesitant as she answers, “Okay… that’s good to hear.” I wonder if she means it. “Did you figure out the work situation?”
    “I quit.”
    “Oh no, I’m sorry.”
    “Why? I needed to, it was a terrible environment for me.”
    “Yes, but the apartment…”
    “It’s fine, I’m looking at other places. Jobs, too.”
    “Okay…” again, she sounds reluctant, like she has more to say.
    I wonder why she even called. Was it just to silently judge me like this? That’s not what I need from her right now.
    “Are you and Rob still in contact with him?” I ask.
    Chelsea offers a cowardly half-answer, “Oh, um… you and Simon are both good friends of ours.”
    “How could you still call him a friend, knowing what he did to me?” I question her. “He tried to bring me down, change me, make me into a doormat.”
    “Mia, I—”
    “He wanted to silence me. Chels, don’t you know how much he hurt me? No, don’t you believe me?”
    “Look,” she says, soft but stern, “all I know is that you’re both hurt. That’s what I believe. The rest is between the two of you. Reach out when you’re ready. I can’t handle you like this.”
    The harsh beeping of her hanging up pierces somewhere deep inside of me. I draw my knees to my chest and lower my head. My long hair falls around me like curtains, enclosing me in a dark cocoon. I’m alright now. I’m free. Even if others don’t understand that yet.
