export default `     A few months ago, when my father was let go from the factory, I offered him a job at my start-up as well as one at MetroLine. He turned both down, and wouldn't explain why no matter how many times I asked. I couldn't handle seeing him for a while. That stubborn silence of his only confirmed the underlying resistance he's held towards me ever since I returned. Now I've gotten over it. Gavin and Mom have started getting concerned, so I take initiative to extend an olive branch.

     "Oh, I don't know Junior, I can't accept this." Senior says, his glasses perched on the tip of his nose as he examines the new watch I bought him like it's a precious artifact. "This one's holding up just fine." He pats the scratched up watch on his wrist, the only one I've seen him wear my whole life. "I got this for you, though. Like the new tote for Mom." "Nah, you should keep it son. Don't worry about providing these things, you're young." I can tell by the way Senior purses his lips that he's holding back from nagging me about saving my money. No matter how many times I've explained my investments, portfolio, and plans for the future, my father can't let go of his conservative instincts. By now, he's had to accept my success, but the refusal of my gift means he still has deeper doubts. "Well, if you're still uncomfortable I guess I'll keep it." I say, trying to sound calm. "It's not like that- I just think it suits you better. Won't it impress those high schoolers you do those financial lessons for? That'll make them pay attention." Senior laughs, attempting to smooth things over. "That's right." I push aside my frustration and smile. I can't force him to understand. I just have to show him, eventually, that I've made the right choices- for us and for this community. I take the brand new watch and fasten it around my wrist. When I look up, Senior is watching me with soft eyes, like I'm still a child. What's with that? "It looks perfect on you, Junior."
