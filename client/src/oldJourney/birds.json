Seeing myself so out of control was a new kind of scary, and it didn't go away until I moved out from my parents. In every way you could see things were worse: I was a high-school dropout, living on people's couches, I ate much less, but inside I felt reborn. Light for the first time in years. That was the first time I started going by 'Jules'."

This was either accepted or not, but not once did I hold onto the response. After everything, I was free."
