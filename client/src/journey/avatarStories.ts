  `     It was a hot day towards the end of fifth grade when I suddenly turned off from my typical route home. My bookbag repeatedly thumped against my back as the bicycle rumbled down the uneven dirt road, approaching the abandoned home I’d heard whispers about in school. After stopping in the lot’s front yard I leaned my belongings against the wide trunk of an old oak tree. A simple wood plank swing hung from its sturdiest branch. When I sat on it my toes dangled just above the blades of overgrown grass. I dug around my pockets for my IPod and opened my “Ballroom” playlist. “Sing, Sing, Sing” came on- the song our dance instructor used to teach us the swing. The fitting coincidence brought a brief smile to my face as I pumped my legs to pick up momentum on the actual swing. 

     I closed my eyes to imagine practicing my steps. I had it down, every triple step and turn. I pushed my legs out and swung even higher. As my stomach lurched I realized I was imagining the wrong role, the lead. The fuzzy image of my own shorter form entered my mind’s eye. I watched myself stumble as the boy pulled me along. My eyes shot open, the view of the blue sky and leafy oak branches chasing away the unpleasant image. I reached higher on each rope and pulled myself up, standing upright on the seat of the swing. With a deep breath I shut my eyes again, hoping to see the dance through to the end. This time I was on the stage with the rest of the grade, and as my partner spun me I saw the magenta skirt Mom bought for the occasion flare out around me. And this time, my eyes were forced open by the sudden feeling of air beneath my feet, which had fully slipped from the plank.`,
  `     That accident broke my arm. I thought it would be devastating to miss out on so much, like the ballroom dance show and Twelfth Night production preceding our graduation ceremony. After all, I’d been cast as the fairy queen Tatiana, a role that all the other girls in my class coveted. I had diligently memorized my lines outside of class time, determined to prove I was the right choice. Everyone knew I loved dance, so I had to master the ballroom routines as well- hence the playlist I often listened to on repeat. In the end all my effort amounted to nothing, and at first I was just as frustrated as Mom.

	     I sat in the audience of the auditorium during dance and theater class, watching my peers rehearse. The new Tatiana looked so graceful as she skipped onto stage in her glittering wings. But strangely, I didn’t feel all that bitter or disappointed. Instead, I settled into strange and private peace. As skirts twirled and familiar ballroom tracks played I felt every expectation, every role that clung to my skin and tangled in my hair shed away. 
	
       Once my cast was removed, I often found myself returning to the swing I had fallen from. With the wind rushing past me and the sky closer than ever, I could almost relive that fleeting contentment. 
`,
  `     As a teen I gradually discarded every personal item that felt like a mask: butterfly wall decals, colorful clothes, my old glitter-covered backpack. It was fine until that Easter Sunday, when Mom realized I had no dress to wear to my grandparents’ place. I think that was when it clicked for her: this wasn’t the typical phase of a teen trying to mature too fast.
     Mom was silent as she drove us to Macy’s. Once inside, I was overwhelmed by frigid AC’d air that stank of floral soap and the vice-like grip Mom held on my wrist while pulling me through the store. There wasn’t a sound between us, only the feel-good pop songs that blared from all directions as Mom led us to the women’s section. She stopped in front of the very first rack and took a random dress, pushing it to my chest with enough force to feel like a punch. I held onto it quickly, as if it were the reins of a spooked horse. But it gave me no power to steer as Mom ushered me into a changing room. Finally having a moment to myself, I looked over the dress and noticed just how awful it really was. I called out to Mom, telling her how the colors didn’t look right for me, and it might be a size too big. “Put it on.” She spat back, sounding closer to the other side of the door than I expected. I tried to open the door to show her, but the handle wouldn’t budge. My stomach lurched and my heart began to hammer in my chest. “I said put it on.” Mom repeated while holding the changing room door shut from outside.
     The family photo taken that day was framed and hung in the entry hallway of the house. In it, I stood off to the side as if trying to avoid the camera, but my awkward distance from the group only brought more attention to the ill-fitting sundress cluttered with garish floral patterns. My short hair failed to hide the sales tag that poked out from my neckline. That became the last printed picture of me displayed at home. 
`,
  `The day after that terrible Easter, I had geometry class first period. I laid my head down on my desk, It wasn’t as if I’d be participating anyway. Besides, I actually performed well in that course when it came to assignments and exams, so one period of slacking should’ve been excusable. As soon as my cheek touched the cool surface of my desk, I heard the stern stride of Mr.Acker approach. He began to yammer in my ear with more passion than he ever spared any of his lessons. Even when I promised to still pay attention, or that it would be just for today- just one period of ease, he doubled down, taking further offence at my attempt to negotiate. 
It hit me then: he had been waiting for this moment. I recalled how I was always cold called more than the other quiet students, and how Mr.Acker spent the majority of test periods hovering around my desk. Now that I’d finally given him something to call “misbehavior”, he wouldn’t let it go. I shot up from my seat, and faced him eye to eye before pushing past him, intending to leave the room. Something suddenly jerked me back, and I spun around to find the hood of my sweatshirt clenched tight in his knobby knuckles. Before I could form a full thought, my own clenched fist went hurtling towards the sickening smirk on his face. 
	Following that incident, my life at high school became just as suffocating as my life at home. Suddenly everyone had a reason to feel justified in making me a target. Perhaps due to my immaturity, I figured I might as well do at school what I couldn’t do at home: act out. Every time I responded to a teacher’s provocation by yelling, shutting down, or storming out, I was foolishly pouring myself into the mold they had created.
`,
  `My hand shook as I tried the key, it had been half a year since I dropped out of high school and got kicked out of home. To my relief, the sound of a click confirmed they hadn’t changed the locks. Even though I chose a time both Mom and Dad would be out of the house, a chill of unease seized me as soon as I stepped inside. After couch surfing and living out of my backpack for months, I finally found a stable enough serving job to split rent with a few roommates. As nice as it was to be able to settle in, I had dreaded returning to my parents’ house for my things. 
My room was just as I had left it- a complete mess. I set the rolling suitcase my roommate Sam lent me on my unmade bed and began to pack. It hadn’t been all that long since the days that I’d come home, lock myself in my room, and amp up my minispeaker to its limit. Yet looking at it now felt strangely distant, as if it had been years since I was that helpless wild teen.
I was almost shocked by my own collection of excess: half-full journals with more doodles than notes, piles of redundant clothes, peeling band posters, random trinkets I had assigned some sentimental value. Living lightly made me realize how little I really needed. I folded up a few plain, work-appropriate shirts. My favorite graphic tee- featuring a cartoon rave couple ballroom dancing- called to me. I nearly placed it in the suitcase before I came to my senses and tossed it aside. I had no need for that kind of cope anymore.
I was about to leave the room before I glanced over my shoulder to give it one last look. I didn’t think or hesitate when I let go of the suitcase and rolled up my sleeves. I just started tidying up like it was the natural thing to do. I didn’t listen to any music or set a timer like I usually would while cleaning. I simply worked silently- my hands moving on their own to organize my desk, straighten up posters, and put away clothes. The last thing I did was fluff the pillow on my made up bed. Satisfied, I clicked the light switch off and left without looking back. The suitcase I pulled glided on the hardwood floors with the same pace and rumble as when I entered. But as I dragged it behind me I could feel the subtly increased weight from my belongings.
`,
  `Working as a receptionist at a hotel with Sam was one of the easier jobs I had. Though we didn’t live together anymore, Sam pulled some strings to get me even working the same shift as him. We must have made quite the sight: sitting side by side with our bound chests, short hair, and ambiguous hormone-altered voices asking “How can I help you today?” 
           Sam knew how to take full advantage of the position. He would bring in his drawing tablet and connect it to the desktop, flipping from his illustration to the guest registration window whenever a customer or higher up walked by. He always offered me a chance to try it out, and one day I gave in.
       It was a slow weekday, I’d barely seen anyone even pass by on the street for the first two hours of our late night shift. I picked up the pen and made a few strokes on the tablet, watching how they dashed across the desktop screen. One button could completely undo a drawn line, as if it was never there to begin with. It was completely different from the feel of a #2 pencil on composition notebook paper, and the pink eraser that could never fully scrub away a smudge of graphite. I slipped an earbud into one ear and let random songs from my favorites list play while I made all sorts of shapes, colors, and textures flash onto and off of the screen. 
     “You know you can save your work and just open a new canvas for a blank page.” Sam sighed. “At this point you’re not drawing, you’re dancing.”
     I smiled and shrugged, then froze as I saw his expression crumble into dread. I clumsily switched to a new window, but it was too late. When I turned around, our manager asked to speak to us both, individually. 
       I kept my mouth shut and a week later I was fired. A few days afterwards, I received a gift in the mail from Sam: a new drawing tablet, just for me. It came with a note in which he admitted that he threw me under the bus, falsely assuming that I would do the same.
`,
  `With nothing left to stay for, I took myself, my savings, one suitcase of belongings, and a backpack on a one-way flight to California. My first stop was an RV dealership, where an overzealous salesman led me around the baking hot lot. He proudly presented the latest top models of Class A and C motorhomes. I was impressed by the sleek storage, private bedrooms, high-tech kitchenettes, rain showers, and skylights, until they were followed up by a fair but enormous price.
The next price bracket took me to the older models of towable trailers with classic furnishings and warm beige color pallets. Unfortunately, the cost was still a bit startling. My salesman grew reluctant, but I insisted on seeing the true deals. In a shady corner towards the back of the lot there were a few options well within my budget: used campervans. Some looked like they came straight from a demolition derby, and none of them were particularly roomy. But like fate, a humble baby blue beauty sporting only a few scratches caught my eye. She was compact- a skinny bed took up most of the space between the kitchenette and bathroom, which did not include a shower. A single fish-patterned curtain in front of the toilet was the most privacy the vehicle offered. 
I named her Skylark, Sky for short. The tablet I refused to touch out of bitterness, but brought along anyway, finally became of use. With it, I designed an emblem of a bird swooping around the sun, and had it painted over the most noticeable scratch. 
With that, my grudge was dissolved and something within me was opened up. I began to draw everyday, even posting some of my pieces: fanart from the latest popular franchise, comic strips about whatever odd job I worked, and portraits of the people I met. Through different commissions and side projects I earned some bonus income for myself. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to supplement my travel funds as needed. 
`,
  `A few years into retirement I suddenly awoke with a hollowing loneliness. I got to work making phone calls and sending out letters, emails, and texts. The time had finally come for me to hit the road again. It was my most extensively planned trip across the country, designed for the purpose of visiting anyone and everyone I knew. There were plenty of people I’d met on the road in my nomadic phases, and others I befriended in the various places I tried to settle down in.
         My last stop was with Tina and Mark, a couple I had met rather early on in my journey. I was worried it had been too long to reunite comfortably, but despite changing over the years, we got on like old friends.
We met on the beach as the sun set. I folded out the tarp extension from the side of my van and they brought foldable chairs to prop up in the sand underneath. We reclined with a sigh and got to talking, passing around Pinot and dried dates. At some point Tina clapped her hands and pointed at my van.
“Oh! We need to show you! After we first met you, Mark and I loved that design so much that we just had to ink it.” 
I’d long since upgraded from Skylark, but I kept the emblem on every vehicle I owned. The heavily tattooed couple each held out an arm, and sure enough, that swooping bird sat just below their wrists. Any lingering regret over never putting down roots was carried away by my delighted laughter.
The two got up and swayed in each other's arms to the rhythm of the lapping waves and crackling bonfire. I retrieved a pen and took out my travel sketchbook, opening to one of the last remaining blank pages.

  `I check the sticky note to make sure we’re at the right house: 153 Oak street. I look back at the brownstone, the bronze plaque reads “153”. The door swings open only a split second after I ring the doorbell.
	“Andy!”
Mom must be really surprised, she always calls me Junior, never Andy, since that’s also my dad’s name. 
	“Are you okay? You even brought the twins!” She gasps, noticing Gavin and Kierra at my side. 
	“Yea, we’re fine. We just wanted to surprise you at work” I explain.
	She puts her fingers to her brow- not a good sign.
	“Junior, are you crazy? I gave you the address for emergencies. And you even dragged the twins all the way here on foot. They can’t be outside like this during allergy season, you know that.”
	“But we wanted to see you too!” Gavin pipes up.
	“I know, baby. This is on your big brother.” Mom sighs. On me? I feel my stomach drop.
	“I’m sorry Mom, I thought it’d be fun, the twins were all upset and crying and-” 
	“You meant no harm, I get it. Relax.” She shakes her head. Children’s laughter rings out from further inside the house. “I’ve got to go now, these kids are young I can’t keep my eyes off them for long. But here, take this and get a cab home.” She takes some folded up cash from her back pocket and hands it to me. She starts to shut the door, but steps back onto the stoops and plants a kiss on my forehead. I make a face, I’m 13- too old for that mushy stuff, but it does make me feel lighter inside. 
	In the cab home the twins sit on either side of me, both seem on the verge of falling asleep. I didn’t realize how quickly young kids wear out. Kierra is the first to doze off, laying her head in my lap. I keep my eyes locked on the window, unable to look away from this unfamiliar side of the city: street planter boxes with color flower arrangements, curly fur dogs groomed like hedges, and an unbelievable amount of cafes and restaurants.
`,
  `“Here, breakfast.” I hand Jas the coffee and chocolate donut I picked up on the way to her house. She lifts off the lid and brings the cup up to her nose. Her eyes close like she’s savoring the smell of premium espresso, not Deli drip coffee. 
“Thanks babe.” 
As we start walking to the bus stop I take out a greasy paper bag and tear off a chunk of cruller, popping it into my mouth.
“So, how come I didn’t see you in Spanish yesterday? Again.” Jas asks.
I try to prematurely swallow the bite of cruller, which sends me into a coughing fit. Jas laughs and slaps my back a few times, with almost too much force. 
“It’s the last class of the day so I beat the rush home if I skip. And yesterday I actually really had to, I had an interview downtown.”
“Downtown? You didn’t tell me about that.” She scrunches her nose in disgust.
“I know you think it’s all gentrified and shit down there, but if I can get a gentrified paycheck out of it, maybe it’s not too bad.” I joke. “I interviewed to be a doorman at a commercial building. I didn’t tell you since I thought I’d get turned down, but yesterday it went kinda well. I think I have a good chance.”
“Congrats, I guess. But that was like the fifth time you’ve missed Spanish.”
“Good thing it’s the least important subject.”
Jas looks frustrated. “That’s not the point. It’ll still look bad on paper. Real bad for college apps.” 
“College?” I scoff. Then I remember she’s my girl, my girl with that light in her honey colored eyes. She’s my girl who wants to walk the straight path after losing her big brother, and she wants to take me with her. “I’m still thinking about it.” I add.
Jas sips her coffee silently for a moment. The ends of her scarf flutter in the crisp morning breeze. “You’ve been plotting with Ty and Noah, still? About turning this place around?”
The bus screeches to a slow halt in front of us and the door pops open with a mechanical hiss. 
I’ve known Ty and Noah my whole life, we’re each other’s closest friends. We all have family here, people we can’t bring ourselves to leave behind. Noah is a few years older, he hasn’t gone to college but he’s set on joining the city council. Honestly, it’s possible. He knows everyone, has connections in both the brightest and darkest ends of this community, including the people that Jas can never forgive. 
As I sit down with her, I answer carefully, “We’ve been talking. It’s just talk, as always.”
	Jas doesn’t respond. She leans her head against the window and closes her eyes.
`,
  `I’m probably going to be fired for randomly dipping mid-shift, but for now I don’t care. The only thing on my mind is that phone call from Gavin- his trembling voice begging for help. He follows close as I pick up Kierra’s limp body and stow her in the cab. I can hear her wheezing and Gavin’s faint sniffles as we speed to the ER.
	“What do you mean wait? She can’t breathe, look at her!” I shout at reception.
	“Everyone is here for an emergency and tonight, like most nights, we’re backed up, there’s nothing we can do.”
	I curse under my breath. “How far is the next closest ER?”
	“At least a half an hour, and they’re also always busy. You’re better off waiting here.”
	We sit in that crowded waiting room, surrounded by coughing and groaning and the stench of blood. Keirra leans on my shoulder, wheezing heavier than before.
	“What happened to Kierra?” I ask Gavin, who sits on the other side of her. 
	“She has hay fever, it started yesterday. Mom and Dad both work tonight so I was looking after her. She was just sleeping when she suddenly had a coughing fit, and after that she’s been struggling to breathe.”
	“Did you give her the inhaler?”
	“The one we had expired, Mom and Dad were trying to get a new one but there were some issues with insurance or something, I don’t know, it was taking a while to get.”
	I feel frustration heat up my skin, but all I can do is close my eyes. 
	“Sorry for making you leave work. You’re the only one who could make it in time.”
	I reach over Kierra to place a hand on Gavin’s shoulder. “You did the right thing, and that’s not what I’m pissed about.”
	My anger was for my namesake, a man who didn’t know how to hustle. Mom, who doesn’t even have a work Visa, has a better work ethic than him and is always finding better paying families to work for. Dad, a citizen, has just maintained his mid-level position at a factory with a 2 hour commute for the past decade. Whenever he’s around he smiles like we’re rich and acts like a caring father, but he can’t even get the twins their life-saving medicine. 
	“Andy? Andy that kinda… hurts.” Gavin’s voice pulls me back and I release the grip I unconsciously tightened.
	“Sorry Gav, I got distracted.”

	When they finally took Kierra in after two hours of waiting, a nurse emerged just fifteen minutes later to tell us our sister was dead.
`,
  `Mitchel, Duke, and I sit in the back of the Humvee as it rumbles along, stirring up clouds of sand as we travel back to base. It’s another uneventful day of re-scouting areas of the empty desert. We rehash old stories of rare enemy encounters, further exaggerating the moments of action with each retelling. Always an even closer encounter, an even cleaner shot, an even more terrified expression on the target’s face, etc. I know from Gavin’s letters that it’s the type of talk that would horrify a college discussion circle and spark a lecture on humanity, violence, and the evils of Western conquest. Sometimes a lingering sentiment in line with that criticism shoots through me, but I ignore it every time. I’m here to provide for myself, for my family, for our future. 
	“And that’s when I realize I only have half a mag left…” Duke says, a grin creeping across his sun-burnt face.
	The Humvee drives over something and I hear, or feel, an almost imperceptible whistle of a ‘click’. There’s a flash of white light and the next thing my vision captures is a ball of flames. A force hits me like a punch and I’m slammed through the side door I’d been leaning against while an enormous bang registers to my ears. I feel a pop deep in both my ears as a second wave of wind sends me flying away from the vehicle. 
	At first I can’t sense any pain in my body, just the ringing in my ears while I try to orient myself in the plume of dust. Then I see the Humvee several yards from me, flipped upside down and engulfed in flames. Suddenly sensation returns to me, searing pain spreads across my skin. I open my mouth to scream, but the pang of stabbing pain from my right thigh rips my voice from me. I look down and see the piece of shrapnel lodged in my leg, and I feel my consciousness flicker. A scorching heat inside of me keeps me awake, the heat of indignation and resentment for everything I haven’t yet seen achieved. 
	I roll onto my side, keeping my uninjured leg on the ground as I pull myself forward, crawling, no, dragging myself away from the blazing wreckage.
`,
  `The parts of my 5am jog that typically ground me- the steady rhythm of my breath, the familiar storefronts, the soles of my sneakers hitting the pavement- fade into the background as my thoughts take over.
	Gavin turned down my invitation to this jog, as usual, but this time he added that he’d join me this weekend. Why did he give in? He hates early mornings. I know he must’ve sensed my growing restlessness. 
	I pass by yet another abandoned lot. Like all the others it’s got barriers up but no signage or scaffolding, no hint of a future beyond an eyesore that keeps rent down. Then, in the pale darkness of dim streetlights, I glimpse someone in my periphery. It happens some mornings, but today I’m on edge. I turn left at the corner and the figure mirrors me. 
	Was Mom right? Has giving back to my community- what she calls “flaunting wealth”- put a target on my back? When I hear the stranger’s footsteps fall faster, my legs react before I do, attempting to break into a sprint. That old ache shoots through my right leg and my knee nearly buckles. I bite back a groan and duck into the stairway entrance of a home. I keep my back against the wall and wait. Right as my pursuer turns into the entryway, I move to lunge, but first I catch a glimpse of his face and stop.
	“Jesus, Andy!” Noah exclaims. “I just wanted to say hello. Didn’t you hear me calling out to you?”
	“No… sorry, I don’t know what just happened. You okay?” 
	“Yea, I’m good. What about you? How’s it to be home again? I wanted to drop by some time, but I didn’t know if you’d be cool with that since you stopped writing back a while ago.”
	“Oh. That was just, that was on me. It wasn’t personal. But what are you doing out here so early?” I clumsily change the subject, but Noah lets it slide. He picks up the clipboard that he dropped in surprise.
	“Just some city council business. Ty’s company- MetroLine- is interested in making a concrete plant in the area. It would hopefully spark some development, or at least make it easier.” Noah replies.
	In that moment, I feel transported back to our juvenile meetings at Noah’s tiny apartment. The adrenaline lingering inside me with nowhere to go finally dissipates. “Tell me more.”
`,
  `A few months ago, when my father was let go from the factory, I offered him a job at my start-up as well as one at MetroLine. He turned both down, and wouldn’t explain why no matter how many times I asked. I couldn’t handle seeing him for a while. That stubborn silence of his only confirmed the underlying resistance he’s held towards me ever since I returned. 
Now I’ve gotten over it. Gavin and Mom have started getting concerned, so I take initiative to extend an olive branch.
	
“Oh, I don’t know Junior, I can’t accept this.” Senior says, his glasses perched on the tip of his nose as he examines the new watch I bought him like it’s a precious artifact. “This one’s holding up just fine.” He pats the scratched up watch on his wrist, the only one I’ve seen him wear my whole life.
	“I got this for you, though. Like the new tote for Mom.”
	“Nah, you should keep it son. Don’t worry about providing these things, you’re young.”
	I can tell by the way Senior purses his lips that he’s holding back from nagging me about saving my money. No matter how many times I’ve explained my investments, portfolio, and plans for the future, my father can’t let go of his conservative instincts. By now, he’s had to accept my success, but the refusal of my gift means he still has deeper doubts.
	“Well, if you’re still uncomfortable I guess I’ll keep it.” I say, trying to sound calm. 
	“It’s not like that- I just think it suits you better. Won’t it impress those high schoolers you do those financial lessons for? That’ll make them pay attention.” Senior laughs, attempting to smooth things over.
	“That’s right.” I push aside my frustration and smile. I can’t force him to understand. I just have to show him, eventually, that I’ve made the right choices- for us and for this community. I take the brand new watch and fasten it around my wrist. When I look up, Senior is watching me with soft eyes, like I’m still a child. What’s with that?
	“It looks perfect on you, Junior.”
`,
  `Jas stands at the podium alone, gripping a folder of papers. Myself and the council sit facing her from elevated tables arranged in an arc, as if we plan to encircle her, trapping her in the center. Her eyes don’t waver or pause when she sees me, she probably already knew I’d be here. 
	“I am Jasmine Waters, and I own and run the daycare located on Beacon street. I’m here to inform you, the council, that you are making a terrible mistake. This plant will pollute the air where young children play, sleep, eat, and live. Your grand plans are not worth the cost of the long-term health of our future generations. These developing children deserve to breathe clean air, their hardworking parents deserve peace of mind.”

	A brief back and forth takes place, but I don’t say a word. Neither does Noah. The next concerned member of the public is called to the stand. I watch Jas exit the room and quickly excuse myself to follow her.
	“Jas, wait.” I call to her in the hallway. She stops, but doesn’t say anything. I continue in an unsteady fervor, “This project, it’s not meant to be like this- I mean, it’s really an opportunity to bring so much to the community. The location… It can't be changed now, it’s too ideal. It’s not near any schools or hospitals, and it's close to port and highway access.” Jas looks ready to turn around, so I blabber on. “The daycare, I’ll relocate it. Just wait, once the plant is in operation for a bit and I’ve earned from my investment, I can completely cover moving your daycare anywhere in the city- even downtown-”
	“Don’t even think of touching what I own.” Jas cuts me off with a certain sharpness in her even toned voice. “Do you even know just how hard we all fought while you were off bloodying your hand? We had to pull out all the stops to prevent MetroLine from taking away one of our only local public schools. Now you’re inviting them back with open arms and that dirty money. You’ve really made such great opportunities, just for you and a select few people. Not for all of us. Don’t delude yourself.” She walks off before I can respond, but I’m left without words anyway. No defense makes it way to my mind, let alone my lips.
`,
  `I decide to take the bus to the cemetery. The crowd on board resembles what I can recall from my high school commute, all appearing to be locals. I turn my focus to the window for the rest of the ride. A sudden spring shower starts, dotting my view with rolling droplets. There aren’t any landscaped planter boxes, but the sidewalks look a bit cleaner, brighter somehow. Though, that could just be a projection of what I want to see.
Scaffolding surrounds what used to be an empty lot. There is a sign, it says commercial, but it blurs into the distance before I can catch what business will be moving in.
	
	When I arrive the drizzle fades and Gavin is already there, without him it probably would’ve taken me a while to find the right plot. The stone has smooth edges, a glossy shine, and defined engravings with “Kierra” in a cursive font. It looks surprisingly new, she must’ve been well cared for by the others all these years. 
	“I’m sorry it took so long for me to visit.” I say aloud, to both of the twins.
	“It’s alright, you were preoccupied for a long time.” Gavin reassures me.
	“Uh-huh, I bet you’re busier now than I ever was, Doctor.”
	Gavin sheepishly rubs the back of his neck, still awkwardly humble about the title he’s earned. 
	“She’d be so proud.” I add. I mean it, but those words sting. Could I say the same about me? The brother that couldn’t even face her resting place for years after the funeral.
	“And it wouldn’t have been possible without you.” Says Gavin. I look away from him. I don’t want to search his face for traces of obligation and hidden resentment. I want to believe him. But facing Kierra leaves me wondering what she’d think of me, of everything I’ve done. 
	“You good?” my brother asks. 
I nod and take out a crystalline bead with a purple hyacinth blossom inside the center, placing it at the base of the stone.
