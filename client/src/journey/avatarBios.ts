  `     Hi there, I’m Jules. I was born in a small midwestern town. Though, having spent most of my life on the road, I wouldn’t say I’m “from” any place in particular. I like folktronica music, the feeling of wind in my hair, and the taste of freshly picked figs. I’m not a fan of crowds, 9-5s, and movies over 2.5 hours. My friends say they like that I’m adventurous and free-spirited, but they all wish I was better at keeping in touch.

     This realm is definitely one of my most notable destinations, but I think it’s about time I move onto the next. I don’t love lingering in the past, but I am glad to share all I’ve learned. However, I’m pretty sure I haven’t left much to be resolved. Sure, I’ve had my share of struggles, but I made it out a brighter, fuller person. I don’t cower, hide, or shut down anymore. I simply introduce myself as Jules, wherever I land, and it’s either accepted or not.

  `     Andy Lawson Jr., Andy Jr, A.J., Junior, Lawson, or just Andy. I go by any of
those. I don’t do anything halfway. I work as hard as I love. There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing my loved ones experience some ease and success, and seeing the little changes in my city that hint at a brighter future. Still, it was never enough to confirm if I reached the end of my race against time. I’ve been trudging down this one path as fast as I can, and suddenly it’s gone. I didn’t have time to look back. 

     People around me tend to view me as strong. I’m a hero to some, a monster to others. Honestly I also thought I must be strong, stronger than most. Not in the sense that I enjoyed violence, even if I was good at it. I’m talking more about mental fortitude, the ability to grind through tough times. But now I’m not so sure if I even have that. I feel out of place in these strange glimmering streets. Without my family, my mission, or my home, I don’t know what I’m doing.
