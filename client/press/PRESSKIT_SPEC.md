## Description Section

**Introduction text:**
"As the soul of a recently deceased mortal, you arrive in a mysterious realm, known as The City. Leave your earthly woes behind as you take part in a surreal storytelling contest, using memories reshaped into mysterious cards."

**Reason text:**
"Celestial is a softer, more thoughtful game, attempting to engage the player through positive emotional connections. We foster a gently competitive, community-friendly environment utilizing meditative and naturalistic art motifs. You will not find clashing swords or cataclysmic spells here."

## Features Section

**Gameplay description:**
"Build a 15-card deck with minimal limitations, including as many copies of each card as you like. Engage in exciting PvP and PvE matches, earn rewards, and grow your card collection. In a match, use Breath to Speak your cards into a shared Story. When the Story concludes, day turns to night. Cards then take effect, modifying each other. Points are tallied, and the player with the greatest number wins the round! Whoever wins 5 rounds first wins the match."
